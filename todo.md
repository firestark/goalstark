# Todo

## Refactor
Should i put the focus back onto goals and only create tasks via the goal view
'Duplicate' tasks (eg. 2x protein 185, due task with same description + same due date) get 'merged' into 1 element on the task list

### Upsides

- Simpler ui concept (Task list no longer has the ability to add tasks only done via goals)
- Getting task count in goal list is easier 


### Downsides

- Potentially alot of duplicate tasks (Keep current implementation to fix?)
- No longer the ability to find all goals associated to a task (Keep current implementation to fix?)
- For goals with the same task the user now has to create that task twice (Could be fixed with: or choose an existing task)



## Goals

- Adding tasks: Let the system automatically detect when a task that already exists is created
    

- should we make goal add a wizzard?
- Create a good mechanism to set smarter goals
- Should tasks be completed by hand or do we monitor completion by tasks?
- Add the ability to add (custom) categories to goals
- Add the ability to reschedule goals
- Add the ability to add new tasks directly from the choose tasks view

## Tasks

- Add task explanations
- In the task list: Set occurence labels on tasks (daily, due)

## Calendar

- Create a goals / tasks calendar


## Food tracker

- Schematics & graphs

## Onboarding

## Responsive design

## Users & authentication

- Add ability to login with google
- Add ability to reset password
- Redesign login/register screen


## refactor

- Create a dedicated post install mechanism


## UX
