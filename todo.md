## UX

### Tips

- Let your users know that theyâ€™re doing great by acknowledging their progress, and celebrating the success with the user.


### App (Re evaluate later)

Should a task only belong to one goal ever?

### Pros

- The application will be simpler (a goal has tasks and that's it)
- Changing a task doesn't mess up other goals
- The end date of a daily tasks will be a bit more clear
- It's easy to enforce the rule that a task must belong to a goal
- Removing a goal easily removes all connected tasks


### Cons

- How are you going to make the task list (if you crop duplicates how will you show each one for each goal?)
- Some goals are connected we lose the first step of this connection 
- Changing a task potentially needs to be changed for every goal it occurs in 
    (Should be solved in the view to make it explicit ( Found same task in the following goals would you like to update them there too?))
- For some task types it doesnt make sense to have multiple of them (eg protein task)
