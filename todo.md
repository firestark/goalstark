## UX

### Tips

- Let your users know that theyâ€™re doing great by acknowledging their progress, and celebrating the success with the user.


### App (Re evaluate later)

Should a task only belong to one goal ever?

### Pros

- The application will be simpler (a goal has tasks and that's it)
- Changing a task doesn't mess up other goals


### Cons

- Some goals are connected we lose the first step of this connection 
- Changing a task potentially needs to be changed for every goal it occurs in
- For some task types it doesnt make sense to have multiple of them (eg protein task)
